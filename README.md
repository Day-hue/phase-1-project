Exploring the NTSB Aviation Accident Database
================

My data is from kaggle and its about the NTSB aviation accident . It contains information from 1962 and
later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the
United States, its territories and possessions, and in international
waters.

I want to explore this data set to find out which aircrafts have the lowest risk, how accident
rates have changed over time,the comparison of accident rates on  different aircraft manufacturers
and models, and to see how the data in this dataset correlate.

I notice that the file is a bit messed up. Some missing values and some are empty.hence I decide to clean 
the data.
